# FullStack Challenge Frontend

This project was built in React and Redux using the [react slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) starter kit.

### Installation

Install dependencies:

`$ npm install`

Run the development server:

`$ npm start`

Your default browser will automatically open to `localhost:3000`

API requests are sent to a Django server located at `https://fullstack-challenge-backend.herokuapp.com`.  

Until authentication is in place, all users will see the same data.

### TODO

Here are some features I'd like to add next:

1. User auth
2. PropType checking
3. Form submit success messages
4. Form submit error messages
5. Better form validation
5. Edit household
6. Edit person
7. Edit vehicle
8. Loading animations
